The goal of this series it to build "holistic and project-oriented workflows
that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of
doing the statistical analysis itself" (https://rstats.wtf/).

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Setup R to always start with a blank slate.
* Understand what's wrong with `rm(list = ls())` and what to do instead.
* Replace `setwd()` with a project-oriented workflow.
* Control R's startup and manage sensitive information with .Rprofile and .Renviron.
* Manage your R-package library through time, and across increasing versions of R.
* Try a new R package from a temporary library, without changing your main library.
* Debug code with `browser()` and friends.

## Who is the audience?

Verbatim from https://rstats.wtf/, the target learner:

* Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.
* Is largely self-taught.
* Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow them
down or make their work products more brittle.
* Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and
more self-sufficient.

## Why is this important?

By addressing the main causes of friction your data analyses will become faster,
more effective, and more robust.

## Syllabus

### A holistic workflow

This meetup covers selected topics from the section A holistic workflow of [What They Forgot to teach you about R](https://rstats.wtf/).

Objectives:

* Setup R to always start with a blank slate.
* Embrace a project-oriented workflow.
* Practice safe, portable paths.
* Name files so that they order nicely, and humans and machines can read them.
* Organize you analysis inputs, outputs, and code sensibly.

### Next (tentative)

* Selected topics from section II: Personal R Admin.
* Selected topics from section III: All is fail.
