The goal of this series is to lean how to get data from the web. At the end of
this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Get unstructured data from any website.
* Learn why websites that expose an API are more useful.
* Search an API directory for useful APIs.
* Get structured data from a website that exposes an API.

## Who is the audience?

Anyone who needs to gather data from the web, for example, analysts and
developers at 2DII working in the PASTAX project.

## Why is this important?

* As an analyst you may want to know which websites are a good source of data so
that you can explore a particular research question.

* As a developer you may want to know which are the best tools to get data from
the web, so that you can feed it into analyses automatically.

## Syllabus

### Overview

This meetup overviews the difference between getting data from any website
versus from a website that exposes an API.

Objectives:
