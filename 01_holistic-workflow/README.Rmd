## [Saving source and blank slates](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#save-source)

### [Always start R with a blank slate](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#always-start-r-with-a-blank-slate)

* Don't reload the workspace from an .Rdata file.
* Don't save the workspace to an .Rdata file.

### [Restart R often (Ctrl+Shift+F10)](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#restart-r-often-during-development)

Other useful shortcuts:

* In .R:

    * Run selected line: Ctrl+Enter
    * Run all code above: Ctrl+Alt+B
    * Run all code: Ctrl+Shift+Enter

In .Rmd:

## [Project-oriented workflow](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html)

What if you want to shift focus from project A to project B?

### [We need to talk about `setwd("path/that/only/works/on/my/machine")`](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html#setwd)

Bad

```r
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy/data")
df <- read.delim("raw_foofy_data.csv")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("../figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

A little less bad:

* Call `setwd()` is at the very start of a file (obvious and predictable).
* Set the working directory to the project's root (not a subdirectory).
* Build subsequent paths relative to the root.

```r
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy")

library(ggplot2)
df <- read.delim("data/raw_foofy_data.csv")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

But wait! There is something good.

### [Organize work into projects](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html#work-in-a-project)

To make your projects portable follow this convention:

* A "project" folder contains all related files.
* The working directory is set to it.
* All paths are relative to it.

### [Use projects and the here package](https://rstats.wtf/safe-paths.html#use-projects-and-the-here-package)

<https://here.r-lib.org/>

Good.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

df <- read.delim(here("data", "raw_foofy_data.csv"))
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave(here("figs", "foofy_scatterplot.png"))
```

### [IDE support for projects](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html#ide-support-for-projects)

An IDE supports projects helps you do these things:

* Launch the IDE in project A.
* Switch from project A to project B.
* Have both project A and project B open and running independent R sessions.

And when opening a project you IDE (e.g. RStudio) does this automatically:

* Restart R.
* Set the working directory to the root.
* Restore open files.

### [Tricks for opening Projects](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html#tricks-for-opening-projects)

* Have a dedicated folder for your Projects.

```{r}
rstudio_projects <- "/home/mauro/git"
fs::dir_ls(rstudio_projects, regexp = "[.]Rproj", recurse = TRUE)
```

* RStudio knows about recently used Projects.

* Find and Launch Projects with dedicated software.

## [How to name files](https://rstats.wtf/how-to-name-files.html)

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/zCwppDN.png width=400>

Principles:

* Machine readable.
* Human readable.
* Plays well with default ordering.

Awesome:

### [Objects that take a long time to create](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#objects-that-take-a-long-time-to-create)

Isolate each computationally demanding step in its own script:

* Write the precious object to file with 

```r
saveRDS(my_precious, here("results", "my_precious.rds"))
```

* Then do downstream work that reloads the precious object

```r
via my_precious <- readRDS(here("results", "my_precious.rds"))
```

### [Automated workflows](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#automated-workflows)

When orchestrating multiple scripts, try run each in its own R session. 

Options:

* Use the callr package to `source()` each .R file.
* Use `render()` to render each .Rmd in its own R session.
* Use the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package (search for [ds-incubator meetups](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvgdJdJDL-APbB315sB3Lv_2VP2g0ioFO) about targets).

### [What's wrong with `rm(list = ls())`](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#rm-list-ls)

* Problem: It makes your script vulnerable to hidden dependencies.
* Solution: Write every script assuming it will be run in a fresh R process.

Details:

* It only deletes user-created objects from the global workspace, but
* Other changes persist invisibly and can have profound effects, e.g.:

    * Packages that have ever been attached via `library()` are still available.
    * Options that have been set to non-default values remain that way.
    * The working directory is not affected.
