The goal of this series it to build “holistic and project-oriented
workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data
analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself”
(<https://rstats.wtf/>).

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Setup R to always start with a blank slate.
-   Understand what’s wrong with `rm(list = ls())` and what to do
    instead.
-   Replace `setwd()` with a project-oriented workflow.
-   Control R’s startup and manage sensitive information with .Rprofile
    and .Renviron.
-   Manage your R-package library through time, and across increasing
    versions of R.
-   Try a new R package from a temporary library, without changing your
    main library.
-   Debug code with `browser()` and friends.

## Who is the audience?

Verbatim from <https://rstats.wtf/>, the target learner:

-   Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.
-   Is largely self-taught.
-   Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may
    slow them down or make their work products more brittle.
-   Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more
    effective and more self-sufficient.

## Why is this important?

By addressing the main causes of friction your data analyses will become
faster, more effective, and more robust.
